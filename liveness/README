# Summary
These files implement our liveness analyzer.

## makegraph.sml
Creates the control flow graph by creating graph nodes and saving information about each instruction.  Edges are created in a second pass using a jump map that is created in the node creation phase.

## liveness.sml
Creates the interference graph. A approach similar to creating the control flow graph is taken.  Interference nodes are created first, then edges are added in a second pass.
